Welcome to py2js
================

py2js is a Python to JavaScript translator.

It consists of two parts. The ``builtins.js`` library, which is a standalone
JavaScript library implementing Python types and builtin functions, and the
``py2js.py`` script that translates almost any Python code into JavaScript (that
depends on ``builtins.js``).
