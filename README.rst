pyjaco
=====

Python to JavaScript translator.

Webpage: http://pyjaco.org

Mailinglist: http://groups.google.com/group/pyjaco

Installation
------------

Execute the following::

    git clone https://github.com/chrivers/pyjaco
    cd pyjaco
    make

Examples
--------

firefox examples/gol.html

And the game of life should show in the browser. If it doesn't, it's a bug. You
can generate that file using

python examples/gol.py > examples/gol.html

Tests
-----

./run_tests.py

Will run all tests, that are supposed to work. If any test fails, it's a bug.

./run_tests.py foo

Will run all tests with "foo" in the name. Very useful for running a group of tests.

./run_tests.py -a

Will run all tests including those that are known to fail (currently). It
should be understandable from the output.

./run_tests.py -x
or
./run_tests.py --no-error

Will run tests but ignore if an error is raised by the test. This is not
affecting the error generated by the test files in the tests directory.

For more flags then described here

./run_tests.py -h

Single test cases
-----------------

With the "casetest" script you can keep comparing the output of pyjaco to
the output of python on the same python script. It's very useful if you are
debugging the compiler or standard library.

./casetest foo.py

Will run foo.py through python and pyjaco, and display the differences. It
will then display a line of "#", and wait for you to press enter to do another
iteration. When the files match, casetest will exit.

Usage
------------

    import sys
	from pyjaco import Compiler
	code = open("tojs.py", "r")
	compiler = Compiler()
	compiler.append_string(code.read())
	print str(compiler)
